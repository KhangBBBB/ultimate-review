                question: "What are the key activities of file-system management?",
                answer: "File-system management involves organizing files into directories and implementing access control. OS activities related to file-system management include creating and deleting files and directories, primitives to manipulate files and directories, mapping files onto secondary storage, and backing up files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media."
            },
            {
                question: "How does the operating system handle access control in storage management?",
                answer: "Access control on most systems is used to determine who can access what. The operating system is responsible for managing access to files and directories."

                question: "What is buffering in the context of I/O subsystem?",
                answer: "Buffering in the I/O subsystem involves temporarily storing data while it is being transferred. This helps in managing and optimizing the flow of data between the CPU and I/O devices."
            },
            {
                question: "What is caching, and how does it contribute to I/O subsystem performance?",
                answer: "Caching in the I/O subsystem involves storing parts of data in faster storage for performance. It enhances speed by allowing frequently accessed data to be retrieved quickly from the cache rather than the slower main memory or external storage."
            },
            {
                question: "What is spooling in the context of the I/O subsystem?",
                answer: "Spooling in the I/O subsystem refers to the overlapping of the output of one job with the input of other jobs. This helps in improving overall system efficiency and resource utilization."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the purpose of the general device-driver interface in the I/O subsystem?",
                answer: "The general device-driver interface in the I/O subsystem provides a standardized way for the operating system to interact with various hardware devices. It abstracts the details of specific device drivers, allowing the OS to support a variety of devices seamlessly."

                question: "How did the formal definition of virtualization contribute to its expansion beyond IBM?",
                answer: "The formal definition of virtualization specified that a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) provides an environment for programs that is essentially identical to the original machine. It also ensured that programs running within that environment show only minor performance decreases, and the VMM is in complete control of system resources."
            },

            {
                question: "How does virtualization protect the host system and VMs?",
                answer: "The host system is protected from VMs, and VMs are protected from each other. This helps prevent the spread of viruses, and sharing is facilitated through shared file system volumes and network communication."
            },
            {
                question: "What are some actions that can be performed on a running VM?",
                answer: "Actions such as freeze, suspend, and running VM can be performed. VMs can be moved or copied to another location and then resumed. Snapshot functionality captures a given state, allowing restoration to that state. Some Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) enable multiple snapshots per VM. Cloning involves creating a copy and running both the original and the copy."

            {
                question: "What distinguishes the VMM type I?",
                answer: "In this implementation, the VMM is part of the firmware, and the operating system requires no special modifications. Each guest in this scenario has dedicated hardware, resulting in a smaller feature set compared to other types of virtualization."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a challenge in implementing I/O for VMM type I?",
                answer: "Implementing I/O is challenging because it's difficult to have enough devices and controllers to dedicate to each guest."

                question: "How is shared I/O handled in some cases in VMM type I?",
                answer: "In some instances, the VMM implements a control partition that runs daemons, and other guests communicate with this partition for shared I/O."
            },
            {
                question: "What unique capability can VMM type I provide in terms of virtualization?",
                answer: "This type of VMM can offer virtualization-within-virtualization, where a guest itself can act as a VMM with its own set of guests. Other types of VMMs may have difficulty achieving this."

                question: "Why is Type 2 VMM implementation considered less interesting from an OS perspective?",
                answer: "Type 2 VMM implementation is less interesting from an OS perspective because there is very little OS involvement in virtualization. The VMM is treated as another process, run, and managed by the host operating system."
            },
            {
                question: "How is the Type 2 VMM managed by the host in terms of OS involvement?",
                answer: "The Type 2 VMM is simply another process run and managed by the host operating system. Even the host is unaware that it is running a VMM and virtualizing guests."
            },
            {
                question: "What is a characteristic of Type 2 VMMs in terms of overall performance?",
                answer: "Type 2 VMMs tend to have poorer overall performance compared to other virtualization approaches because they can't take full advantage of some hardware features."
            },

                question: "What is a benefit of Type 2 VMMs despite their potential performance limitations?",
                answer: "A benefit of Type 2 VMMs is that they require no changes to the host operating system. This means that the host OS remains unchanged, simplifying the implementation process."
