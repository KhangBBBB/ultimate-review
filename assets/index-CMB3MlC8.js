In such cases, if a process terminates, all its children must also be terminated. The termination is initiated by the operating system, leading to the termination of all descendants."},{question:"How is cascading termination managed in an operating system?",answer:"Cascading termination is managed by the operating system, which initiates the termination of all children, grandchildren, and so on, if a parent process terminates. This ensures a clean and systematic termination of all related processes."},{question:"What role does the wait() system call play in the termination of child processes?",answer:"The wait() system call allows the parent process to wait for the termination of a child process. It returns status information and the process identifier (pid) of the terminated process. This enables the parent to gather information about the terminated child process."},{question:"How is the wait() system call used in obtaining information about terminated processes?",answer:"The parent process uses the wait() system call to wait for the termination of a child process. The call returns the process identifier (pid) and status information of the terminated process, which can be stored and analyzed by the parent."},{question:"What is the purpose of the pid = wait(&status) statement in process termination?",answer:"The statement pid = wait(&status) is used in process termination to wait for the termination of a child process. It assigns the process identifier (pid) of the terminated process to the variable 'pid' and returns status information about the termination in the variable 'status'."},{question:"What is the typical architecture of web browsers in terms of processes?",answer:"Many web browsers traditionally ran as a single process, but some still follow this model. However, modern browsers are moving towards a multiprocess architecture for improved stability and security."},{question:"What are the drawbacks of a single-process web browser architecture?",answer:"In a single-process web browser architecture, if one website causes trouble, the entire browser can hang or crash. This lack of isolation can lead to a less stable user experience."},{question:"How does the Google Chrome Browser differ in terms of its process architecture?",answer:`The Google Chrome Browser follows a multiprocess architecture with three different types of processes, providing enhanced stability and security:
1. Browser process manages user interface, disk, and network I/O.
2. Renderer process renders web pages and handles HTML, Javascript. A new renderer is created for each website opened, running in a sandbox to restrict disk and network I/O and minimize the impact of security exploits.
3. Plug-in process is dedicated to each type of plug-in.`},{question:"What is the role of the browser process in the Chrome Browser's architecture?",answer:"The browser process in the Chrome Browser manages the user interface, disk, and network I/O. It serves as the central coordinator for various functions within the browser."},{question:"What functions does the renderer process perform in the Chrome Browser?",answer:"The renderer process in the Chrome Browser is responsible for rendering web pages, handling HTML, and executing Javascript. A new renderer process is created for each website opened, running in a sandbox to restrict disk and network I/O and enhance security."},{question:"Why is the use of a sandbox for renderer processes important in the Chrome Browser?",answer:"The sandbox for renderer processes in the Chrome Browser is crucial for security. It restricts disk and network I/O, minimizing the impact of potential security exploits, and provides an additional layer of protection for the overall system."},{question:"What is the purpose of the plug-in process in the Chrome Browser's architecture?",answer:"The plug-in process in the Chrome Browser is dedicated to each type of plug-in. It ensures that plug-ins operate in isolated processes, preventing issues with one plug-in from affecting others or the overall browser functionality."},{question:"What is Inter-process Communication (IPC) in the context of operating systems?",answer:"Inter-process Communication (IPC) is the mechanism through which processes communicate with each other in an operating system."},{question:"What are the two primary methods of IPC?",answer:`The two primary methods of IPC are:
1. Shared memory (with a process 'kick'): Fast and involves no data transfer.
2. Message Passing: Distributed and provides better isolation between processes.`},{question:"Describe the Shared memory method of IPC.",answer:"Shared memory in IPC involves processes sharing a common memory region. A 'process kick' is often used to signal the other process to access the shared memory. This method is fast and does not involve actual data transfer between processes."},{question:"Explain the Message Passing method of IPC.",answer:"Message Passing in IPC involves processes communicating by exchanging messages. This method is distributed and provides better isolation between processes, as they do not share memory directly. Messages can be used to transfer data and synchronize processes."},{question:"What is the purpose of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in networked systems?",answer:"Remote Procedure Call (RPC) abstracts procedure calls between processes on networked systems, allowing communication and execution of procedures across different machines."},{question:"What is the role of Stubs in the context of RPC?",answer:"Stubs act as client-side proxies for the actual procedures on the server. They facilitate the communication between the client and server by abstracting the procedure calls."},{question:"What tasks does the client-side stub perform in an RPC?",answer:"The client-side stub in an RPC locates the server and marshalls the parameters. It prepares the necessary information for the remote procedure call and initiates the communication with the server."},{question:"What responsibilities does the server-side stub have in an RPC?",answer:"The server-side stub in an RPC receives the message from the client, unpacks the marshalled parameters, and performs the actual procedure on the server. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, handling the communication and execution process."}]},{title:"OS: Lecture 5",subtitle:"Thread",flashcards:[{question:"What is the notion of a thread?",answer:"A thread is a fundamental unit of CPU utilization and forms the basis of multithreaded computer systems."},{question:"Why are most modern applications multithreaded?",answer:"Most modern applications are multithreaded to run multiple tasks within the application concurrently. This allows for tasks such as updating the display, fetching data, spell checking, and handling network requests to be implemented by separate threads."},{question:"What is the advantage of using threads for tasks within an application?",answer:"Thread creation is light-weight compared to process creation, making it more efficient. Using threads can simplify code and increase overall application efficiency by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently."},{question:"Are kernels generally multithreaded?",answer:"Yes, kernels are generally multithreaded, contributing to better system performance and resource utilization."}]}];function Se(t){let
